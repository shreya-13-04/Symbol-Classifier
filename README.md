# Symbol-Classifier
Symbol Classification using Deep Learning  - This project builds a deep learning-based symbol classifier using a CNN model to recognize and categorize symbols from images. The dataset consists of various labeled symbols, and the model is trained using PyTorch. The output is a CSV file with predicted labels for test images.
